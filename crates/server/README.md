# skrills-server

Core library powering the `skrills` MCP server and CLI. It handles discovery, filtering, manifest construction, pinning, and diagnostics for local `SKILL.md` files.

This crate is intended to be used by the `skrills` binary, but it can also be embedded in custom MCP-compatible tooling.
